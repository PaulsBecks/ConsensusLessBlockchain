# ConsensusLessBlockchain

Implementation of the blockchain described in this paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.05574.pdf

And in /ABC this https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.10926.pdf

In this project I will try to implement the consensus less blockchains, write the nodes a wallet that can be used to interact with the chain and a block inspectore.

# Get Started

Start the python node

```
python install -r requirements.txt
export FLASK_APP=node.py
flask run
```

Start the browser wallet

```
cd consensusless-blockchain-wallet
yarn install
yarn start
```
